	---help---
	  Mediatek proprietary clock management is used to operate
          the clocks. The clocks are composed of CG, MUX, PLL,
          non-MTCMOS. The operations of clocks are enabling,
          disabling, and querying status. If this config is not set,
          system will use COMMON_CLK instead.
