Binding for ISSI IS31FL3236 LED Driver

Required Properties:
	- compatible: "issi,is31fl3236"
	- reg: I2C Slave Address

Optional Properties:
	- setup-device: hard reset the device (toggle enable gpio)
	  and soft reset the device (write 0x1 into enable register)
	- enable-gpio: phandle to the gpio connected to the reset pin
	  Note: ignored if setup-device is not defined.
	- play-boot-animation: start kthread on probe to play boot animation
	  Note: you can still start the kthread by write 1 into the boot_animation
	  sysfs entry
	- channel-offset: Apply an offset to the starting channel for alignment

Example:
	1) Setup the driver on boot and play boot pattern on a device @ 0x3F:
	is31fl3236@3F {
		compatible = "issi,is31fl32326";
		reg = <0x3F>;
		setup-device;
		enable-gpio  = <&gpio 01 0>;
		play-boot-animation;
	};

	2) No setup and no boot animation on a device @ 0x3F:
	is31fl3236@3F {
		compatible = "issi,is31fl32326";
		reg = <0x3F>;
	};

	3) No setup and no boot animation.
	   Shift the starting led by one, which is 3-channels (R, G & B)
	is31fl3236@3F {
		compatible = "issi,is31fl32326";
		reg = <0x3F>;
		channel-offset = /bits/ 8 <3>;
	};
