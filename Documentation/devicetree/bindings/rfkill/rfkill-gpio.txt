GPIO controlled RFKILL devices

Required properties:
- compatible	: Must be "rfkill-gpio".
- rfkill-name	: Name of RFKILL device
- rfkill-type	: Type of RFKILL device: 1 for WiFi, 2 for BlueTooth, etc.
		  See include/uapi/linux/rfkill.h for all valid values
- gpios		: At most two GPIO phandles
- gpio-names	: Shall be "reset" or "shutdown", matching gpios.
		  If both are provided, the "reset" GPIO is toggled first.

Optional properties:
- clocks		: phandle to clock to enable/disable
- poweron-delay         : ms to delay after powering on device
- poweroff-delay        : ms to delay after powering off device
- default-state         : initial state set by driver (<1> = blocked <0> = unblocked)

Example:

	rfkill_bt {
		compatible = "rfkill-gpio";
		rfkill-name = "bluetooth";
		rfkill-type = <2>;
		gpios = <&pio 7 18 0>;
		gpio-names = "reset";
		clocks = <&clk_out_a>;
	};
